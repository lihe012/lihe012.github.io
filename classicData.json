        "title": "Loving During A Pandemic \n疫情期间的爱",
        "details": "It is almost impossible to stage a traditional Valentine's Day outing when everyone is locked up or wearing masks and distancing at least six feet apart. The days of fancy dinners in exotic locations are out of reach. But that doesn't mean that you can't enjoy and show love if you are willing to be creative and wise. \n\n如果每个人都被关起来或戴着口罩，而且彼此之间相距至少6英尺，举办传统的情人节活动几乎是不可能的。在具有异国情调的地方享用豪华晚餐的日子已是遥不可及。但这并不意味着不能享受和表达爱，只要愿意有创造力和智慧就能办到。\n\nLet's examine the three psychological aspects of love:\n\n让我们研究一下爱情的三个心理层面：\n\nThoughts - So many times I have been touched by individuals who tell me that they have been thinking about me. What a compliment! Someone who invests time and energy into reviewing memories or wondering about my well-being is a lovely thing. Those who think about how they can honour another person go even a step further. Planning a surprise or interaction takes commitment and even if you can't meet in person, you can think of ways to make another person's day better. At Christmas, for example, my daughter's family had a full meal delivered to my door for me. Great thoughts turned into thoughtful action. Who are you thinking about this week?\n\n心思-很多时候，那些告诉我他们一直在想我的人让我很是感动。多好啊！有人把时间和精力用来回忆或关心我的幸福是一件美好的事情。那些想着如何尊重他人的人更是可爱。谋划一个惊喜或互动需要承诺，即使不能见面，也可以想方设法让对方的一天过得更好。例如，在圣诞节，我女儿的家人为我送上了丰盛的饭菜。深深的思念变成了深思熟虑的行动。这周你在想谁呢？\n\nFeelings - The first blush of love can bring passionate feelings that are delightful but with time, the feelings often mature into constant assurance, deep loyalty and the confidence of being cared for. When times are difficult, the feelings can fade or even change into ones that are not as pleasant. It is therefore important to know that no matter what happens issues can be resolved and the relationship can last. In fact, shared trouble often builds stronger ties! One warning though - don't always lead with your feelings for they can be like chaff in the wind and change quickly!\n\n感情——爱的第一次脸红可以带来令人愉快的激情，但随着时间的推移，这种感情往往会发展为长久的承诺、深深的忠诚和被关心的信赖。当出现困难的时候，这种感情会消退，甚至变得不那么愉快。因此，重要的是要知道，无论发生什么，问题都可以解决，这样关系才能持久。事实上，共性问题常常能建立更牢固的关系！但要注意——不要总以自己的情感为主导，因为情绪就如风中沙，变化很快。\n\nBehaviours - Proclaiming your love and then treating another person poorly isn't good enough. Your behaviours must match your words. Giving gifts won't make up for disrespect or abuse. Promises are not enough. You can show a person that you love them with simple gestures that will be treasured for years to come. Phone an aged friend and find out that the call made their day! Send a thank you card to someone who didn't expect it. Take out the garbage (before being asked!). Like the popular song from \"My Fair Lady\" states \"Don't talk of love... SHOW ME!\"\n\n行为——仅仅说出你的爱，但对他/她不好，是不够的。必须言行一致。礼物无法弥补不尊重或虐待。光有承诺是不够的。可以用简单的动作向一个人表明对他/她的爱，这些动作将会被珍藏多年。给一位年长的朋友打电话，这个电话会让他们开心一天！给没有预料到的人发一张感谢卡。（在被要求之前！）扔掉垃圾。就像《窈窕淑女》中的那首流行歌曲唱的“不要谈论爱情……表示出来！”\n\nSo, this Valentine's Day will be different - but it might be the best one yet!\n\n所以，这个情人节会有所不同-而且可能是迄今为止最好的一个！\n\nDon't just focus on the romantic part. Instead, make a list of people who you love and then start thinking about how you can behave in an appropriate way to express your feelings. Think about things that they have talked about as wishes in the past and what has pleased them previously. Do research that will offer you new ideas. Try making a card or gift rather than buying one.\n\n不要只关注浪漫的部分。相反，列一张你爱的人的清单，然后开始想如何以适当的方式表达感情。想想他们过去提起过的愿望，以及之前让他们高兴的事情。研究一下，这可以为你提供新的想法。与其买一张卡片或礼物，不如试着自己做。\n\nAnd remember to use your words. There is nothing as powerful and treasured as kind words that are expressed sincerely.\n\n记住用你自己的语言表达。没有什么比真诚表达的话语更有力、更珍贵的了。\n\nLove to all of you who show that you care by reading my columns!\n\n向所有通过阅读我的专栏来表示关心的人表示感谢！\n\nAnd happy pandemic Valentine's Day!\n\n还有，情人节快乐！\n\nArticle Source: https://EzineArticles.com/expert/Linda_Hancock/152728 \n\n 文章来源：https://EzineArticles.com/expert/Linda_Hancock/152728",
